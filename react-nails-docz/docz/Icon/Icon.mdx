# Icon

This component displays an icon. By default FontAwesome-Icons are used. But you can add custom icon components.

## Example

<Box backgroundColor="infoLight">
    <Icon icon="times" />
</Box>

## Properties

### icon - string

Selects the correct icon. If no icon with the provided name is found the default `NotFoundIcon` is displayed.

### color - Color

Sets the color of the icon. Every defined `theme.colors`-value can be used.

## Methods

### addIcon(icons: object | object[])

To add new icons just call the `addIcon` method. For FontAwesome icons you just have to import them and can use them as input directly.

```jsx
import { faTimes } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'
import { addIcon } from 'react-nails'

addIcon(faTimes)

<Icon icon="times"/>
```

Icons can also be renamed. This becomes handy when importing FontAwesome regular and solid icons, where you want to use both icons, but they are named identical

```jsx
import { faBookmark } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'
import { faBookmark as faBookmarkR } from '@fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons'
import { addIcon } from 'react-nails'

addIcon([faBookmark, {...faBookmarkR, iconName:"bookmark-r"}])

<Icon icon="bookmark" />
<Icon icon="boomark-r" />
```

## Playground

    </Inline>
